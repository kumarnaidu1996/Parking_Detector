# Parking_Detector

This project was to identify the available parking spots in a parking lot thereby indicating a driver
before entering the parking lot. 

For this project we used raspbery-py kit and databse (mysql-workbench). The park.py file contains sensor code and main.py file will upload the data recorded from the sensor into database. We fetch the recorded data from the database and visualize the data to analyze the parking spaces and it's status over a different time. For further details, please refer parking_detector.pdf file.

To run the sensor, you have to run main.py file.
