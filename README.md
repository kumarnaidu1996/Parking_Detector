# Parking_Detector

This project was to identify the available parking spots in a parking lot thereby indicating a driver
before entering the parking lot. 

# The Problem
In the modern day, the advancement of technology in the field of mobility has put
multiple forms of transport on the road. With the ever increasing transport sector, the
need for real estate to accommodate the vehicles when not in action is at a rise.
Parking lots in buildings and on roads are usually always found to be
accommodating and really hard to identify vacant spots in case of private vehicles.
Modern day car users face this challenge on an everyday basis, trying hard to find a
vacant spot before running into work or into a supermarket. This brought about the
challenge to identify and indicate the available parking spots to the driver in hand,
based on which the driver can make his way into the parking lot.

For this project we used raspbery-py kit and databse (mysql-workbench). The park.py file contains sensor code and main.py file will upload the data recorded from the sensor into database. We fetch the recorded data from the database and visualize the data to analyze the parking spaces and it's status over a different time. For further details, please refer parking_detector.pdf file.

To run the sensor, you have to run main.py file.
