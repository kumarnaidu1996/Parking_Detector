# Parking_Detector

This project was to identify the available parking spots in a parking lot thereby indicating a driver
before entering the parking lot. 

For this project we used raspbery-py kit and databse (mysql-workbench). The park.py file contains sensor code and main.py file will upload the data recorded from the sensor into database. for further details, please refer parking_detector.pdf file.
